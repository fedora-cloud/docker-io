This package will install the 'docker-container-logrotate' script to
/etc/cron.daily. By default, it will run logrotate on all running containers
and ignore all failures.

Possible issues:
1. This assumes that logrotate is installed on containers to run
successfully.

2. A race condition occurs if a container exits before 'docker
exec' run (though it's ignored)

3. Not all containers may need this (whether logrotate is installed or not)

Suggestions to improve this are welcome
